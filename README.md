# Comparing Go and Rust

This is a code companion for the post:
http://sitr.us/2017/02/21/changes-i-would-make-to-go.html

Go examples are in `go/`, Rust examples are in `rust/`. Each example comes with
tests. Tinker with the code, run the tests, and see what happens!


## Prerequisites

Requires Docker and Make to run


## Running the tests

To run the Go tests:

    make go

To run the Rust tests:

    make rust
